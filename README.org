* xinput persistence for all devices
Typically when trying to setup a keymap, mouse, or other xinput device, the
command is not persistent at boot! Nor is it persistence when the device is
temporarily disconnected. The solution is to either use a sleep function, or to
monitor udev. Here I chose to monitor udev for all devices.

* Installation

First, you need to know a portion of each device's name and device path. Find
these out like this:

```shell
# Plugin the device
$ xinput
...
...DeathAdder...
# Unplug the device
$ udevadm monitor
...
# Now plug it in
UDEV  [2607.521415] add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-1/1-1:1.2/0003:1532:005C.003C/input/input137/input137::numlock (leds)
                               ^^^^^^^^^^
                              Need a string from here, like 'usb'
# I used usb for my devices
```

Now that you have those, modify commands.conf from my personal choices:

```shell
monitor.pl -n 'device name #1' -d 'usb or other part of the path'
monitor.pl -n 'device name #2' -d 'usb or other part of the path'
```

You can have as many devices as required. For example, you might add a PS/2
keyboard also:

```shell
monitor.pl -n 'device name #1' -d 'usb or other part of the path'
monitor.pl -n 'device name #2' -d 'usb or other part of the path'
monitor.pl -n 'N-rollover' -d 'ps/2'
```

The program will fork each one.
